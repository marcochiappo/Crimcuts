<h1>About CrimCutz</h1>

<p>
CrimCutz was created by three Harvard boys — <strong>Marco, Aaryan, and Matthew</strong> — 
who were tired of watching their friends get <em>absolutely violated</em> by bad trims.
</p>

<p>
After years of seeing your boy get wronged at <strong>La Flamme Barber Shop</strong>, 
or getting unlucky at <strong>Atlas</strong> with the wrong boss man, 
we knew something had to change.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Marco:</strong> “No more accidental bowl cuts. No more trust falls with barbers you've never met.”</li>
    <li><strong>Aaryan:</strong> “We’re making sure your fade is cleaner than your GPA.”</li>
    <li><strong>Matthew:</strong> “Harvard men deserve trims worthy of their tuition.”</li>
</ul>

<p>
CrimCutz is the solution: a simple, student-friendly platform to help your bros get a decent trim — every single time.
